# ShadowXeldron's Sonic 3 AIR Mods
 [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://makeapullrequest.com) 
This is my nuclear waste disposal plant. Here, we dispose of nuclear waste. And I guess my Sonic mods are here as well.

These are the mods that have been copied here:
## DISCLAIMER: All mods in this repository are licensed under the GNU GPL version 3.0; with the exception of No SHC Splash which is licensed under the CC0.

Per-Character Themes
-
My first public mod for S3AIR. Simply put, this gives each character their own themes and jingles. It also includes support for Extra Slot Mighty.

Even More Themes [WIP]
-
### This mod is a work-in-progress and should not be considered feature complete!
A WIP project that I'm on and off about. Simply put, what this does is it expands the number of unique sound IDs and plays them at specific moments.

Fun fact: This repository was originally meant for this project, but then AirWay1 bailed on us and got our GameBanana page condemned by the S3AIR Discord. Thus, I ended up repurposing this repository for all my projects.

No SHC Splash
-
Removes the trigger for the Sonic Hacking Contest splash screen, so you don't have to see it every time you boot up the game with SHC mods installed. Unlike all my other script mods, I have dedicated this to the public domain with the CC0 since it's only 5 lines long.


Unnamed Character Mod [WIP]
-
### This mod is a work-in-progress and should not be considered feature complete!
Something that a cobbled together over Easter. It's the start of a new character mod focused on speed and platforming and right now seems to be some kind of overpowered monstrosity. Just a heads up that it's *really* rough right now.

You Are Dead
-
A silly joke mod that replaces the game over and continue music with the game over theme from Total Distortion, or as I like to call it, the You Are Dead song.

Seperare Eggrobo Boss Music
-
Adds unique boss music for Knuckles. This was meant as a part of Even More Themes, but I decided that I want to have a per-act version of the "pinch phase" music from the DS Pack in the mod instead. Since having Knuckles-specific stuff would probably make the mod to complicated, I've opted to split it off into its own script.


Where's your rankings mod?
-
I think that because this repository serves multiple projects it would confuse things for contributiors to the rankings mod (so far called Scoring Revisited). If you want to lend a hand on the project, you can find it here: https://github.com/ShadowXeldron/S3AIR-Scoring-Revisited

But what about your music replacement mods?
-
I don't feel right putting mods which don't have much code in them on GitHub. Because of that, you can find them in my cloud storage [here](https://mega.nz/folder/TiBkDZQD#HYsbMsR-LqBpL3PlbNhw9Q).
