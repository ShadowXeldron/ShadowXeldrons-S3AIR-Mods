# ShadowXeldron's Sonic 3 AIR Mods

This is the my nuclear waste disposal plant. Here, we dispose of nuclear waste. And I guess my Sonic mods are here as well.

These are the mods that have been copied here:

Per-Character Themes
-
My first public mod for S3AIR. Simply put, this gives each character their own themes and jingles. It includes support for Extra Slot Mighty, and some addons can be found with a link in the mod's "extras" folder.

Even More Themes [WIP]
-
### This mod is a work-in-progress and should not be considered feature complete!
A WIP project that I'm on and off about. Simply put, what this does is it expands the number of unique sound IDs and plays them at specific moments.

Fun fact: This repository was originally meant for this project, but then AirWay1 bailed on us and got our GameBanana page condemned by the S3AIR Discord. Thus, I ended up repurposing this repository for all my projects.

No SHC Splash
-
Removes the trigger for the Sonic Hacking Contest splash screen, so you don't have to see it every time you boot up the game with SHC mods installed. Unlike all my other script mods, I have dedicated this to the public domain with the CC0 since it's only 5 lines long.

But what about your music replacement mods?
-
I don't feel right putting mods which don't have much code in them on GitHub. Because of that, you can find them in my cloud storage [here](https://mega.nz/folder/TiBkDZQD#HYsbMsR-LqBpL3PlbNhw9Q).
