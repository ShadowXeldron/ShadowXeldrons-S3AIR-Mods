Per-Character Themes
-
Unique themes are cool

This is a simple mod that allows you to have different themes for each character. It is inspired by a similar idea from [Megamix Mania](https://gamebanana.com/mods/47886).Â   
  
You choose between the new audio definitions or the vanilla Sonic 3 AIR settings. The following can be customized:  
  
*   Act Clear
*   Special Stage Clear (Uses the same themes as Act Clear; you can also choose to use the Sonic CD US Zone Clear jingle)  
*   Invincibility
*   Extra Life  
*   Super Theme
*   Hyper Theme  
*   Game Over
*   Speed Shoes  

By default, Sonic's themes are from Sonic Mania, Tails' themes are ripped directly from the Retro Engine version of Sonic 2, and Knuckles' themes are from Knuckles Chaotix. Every character's credits themes however are their theme songs from Sonic Adventure.  
  
Mighty is also supported! Themes from SegaSonic the Hedgehog will play if you are playing as either [Ultimate Mighty](https://gamebanana.com/mods/54268) or [Extra Slot Mighty](https://gamebanana.com/mods/336038).  
  
They can also be changed using audio replacements! Be sure to load this mod first when using compatible mods. The soundkeys can be found in the mod files for those who would like to use it.  
  
This can be bundled with other mods, as long as you respect the GNU General Public License v3.
