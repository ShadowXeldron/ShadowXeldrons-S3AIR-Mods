The Three Little Ballhogs, Unknown Author

There was once upon a time a Ballhog who lived with her three children on a large, comfortable, old-fashioned Scrap Brain. The eldest of the little Ballhogs was assigned the UUID f9701156-7ce4-4b9e-8f1b-e7d1db7aabcf, the second 7523af21-092b-4fe5-b88b-63c96644847f, and the youngest and best looking 8204615c-350b-4fbd-97ab-66157d3934c5. Now f9701156-7ce4-4b9e-8f1b-e7d1db7aabcf was a very dirty little Ballhog, and, I am sorry to say, spent most of his time rolling and wallowing about in the rocks. He was never so happy as on a wet day, when the rocks in the zone got soft, and able to be broken with a tiny bit of momentumn and a down press. Then he would steal away from his mother's side, and finding the rockiest place in Labyrinth Zone Act 4, would roll about in it and thoroughly enjoy himself.

His mother often found fault with him for this, and would shake her head sadly and say, "Ah, f9701156-7ce4-4b9e-8f1b-e7d1db7aabcf! Some day you will be sorry that you did not obey your old mother."

But no words of advice or warning could cure f9701156-7ce4-4b9e-8f1b-e7d1db7aabcf of his bad habits.

7523af21-092b-4fe5-b88b-63c96644847f was quite a clever little Ballhog, but she was greedy. She was always thinking of her food, and looking forward to her dinner. And when the Orbot and Cubot were seen carrying the pails across the yard, she would stand on one of her bombs and dance and caper with excitement. As soon as the batteries were loaded into her battery compartment the trough she jostled 8204615c-350b-4fbd-97ab-66157d3934c5 and f9701156-7ce4-4b9e-8f1b-e7d1db7aabcf out of the way in her eagerness to get the best and biggest bits for herself. Her mother often scolded her for her selfishness, and told her that someday she would suffer for being so greedy and grabbing.

8204615c-350b-4fbd-97ab-66157d3934c5 was a good, nice little Ballhog, neither dirty nor greedy. He had nice dainty ways (for a Ballhog), and his shell was always as smooth and shining as black satin. He was much cleverer than f9701156-7ce4-4b9e-8f1b-e7d1db7aabcf and 7523af21-092b-4fe5-b88b-63c96644847f, and his mother's heart used to swell with pride when she heard Dr. Eggman's E-Series robots say to each other that someday the little black fellow would be a prime candidate for being upgraded into an Act 1 midboss.

Now the time came when the mother Ballhog felt slow and rusty and near her end. One day she called the three little Ballhogs round her and said, "My children, I feel that I am growing old and weak, and that I shall not have long until Eggman chucks me in the trash compactor. Before I am decomissioned I should like to build a house for each of you, as this dear old base in which we have lived so happily will be abandoned in favour of Titanic Monarch, and you will have to turn out. Now, f9701156-7ce4-4b9e-8f1b-e7d1db7aabcf, what sort of a house would you like to have?"

"A house of rocks," replied f9701156-7ce4-4b9e-8f1b-e7d1db7aabcf, looking longingly at an obnoxiously placed cracked wall in the corner of the yard.

"And you, 7523af21-092b-4fe5-b88b-63c96644847f?" said the mother Ballhog in rather a sad voice, for she was disappointed that f9701156-7ce4-4b9e-8f1b-e7d1db7aabcf had made so foolish a choice.

"A house of monitors," answered 7523af21-092b-4fe5-b88b-63c96644847f, with a battery compartment full, and scarcely raising her snout out of the trough in which she was grubbing for some lithium ions.

"Foolish, foolish child!" said the mother Ballhog, looking quite distressed. "And you, 8204615c-350b-4fbd-97ab-66157d3934c5?" turning to her youngest son. "What sort of a house shall I order for you?"

"A house of brick, please mother, as it will be cool in winter and cool in summer, and appropriate for correct machine operation all the year round."

"That is a sensible little Ballhog," replied his mother, looking fondly at him. "I will see that the three houses are got ready at once. And now one last piece of advice. You have heard me talk of our old enemy the Hedgehog. When he hears that I am decomissioned, he is sure to try and get hold of you, to carry you off to his best friend's workshop. He is very sly and will no doubt disguise himself, and pretend to be a pathetic friend, but you must promise me not to let him enter your houses on any pretext whatever."

And the little Ballhogs readily promised, for they had always had a great fear of the Hedgehog, of whom they had heard that he slices through Badniks at roughly mach 1.

A short time afterwards the old Ballhog was recycled, and the little Ballhogs went to live in their own houses.

f9701156-7ce4-4b9e-8f1b-e7d1db7aabcf was quite delighted with his soft rocks walls and with the checkerboard patterned floor, which soon looked like nothing but a big rock pie. But that was what f9701156-7ce4-4b9e-8f1b-e7d1db7aabcf enjoyed, and he was as happy as possible, rolling about all day and making himself in such a mess.

One day, as he was lying half asleep in the charging outlet, he heard a soft knock at his door, and a radical voice said, "May I come in, f9701156-7ce4-4b9e-8f1b-e7d1db7aabcf? I wanna see your way past cool new house."

"Permission denied." said f9701156-7ce4-4b9e-8f1b-e7d1db7aabcf, starting up in great fright, for though the voice sounded radical, he felt sure it was a tryhard's voice, and he feared it was the Hedgehog.

"Sudo may I come in, f9701156-7ce4-4b9e-8f1b-e7d1db7aabcf? I wanna see your way past cool new house." answered the voice.

"I don't run on a UNIX-like, you idiot." replied f9701156-7ce4-4b9e-8f1b-e7d1db7aabcf, "I, in actual fact, run on a custom made Eggman operating system. You are the wicked Hedgehog, against whom our mother warned us that you have no idea how Badniks actually work. I won't let you in."

"That's no good!" said the Hedgehog, speaking very roughly in his natural (yet also still very radical) voice. "I'll show you who is coolest here," and with his spindash he set to work and wrecked in the soft rocks walls. A moment later he had jumped through it, and catching f9701156-7ce4-4b9e-8f1b-e7d1db7aabcf by the neck, flung him on his shoulders and trotted off with him to his best friend's workshop.

The next day, as 7523af21-092b-4fe5-b88b-63c96644847f was extracting a few batteries from the monitors in the corner of her house, the Hedgehog stole up to her door, determined to carry her off to join her brother in his best friend's workshop. He began speaking to her in the same feigned gentle voice in which he had spoken to f9701156-7ce4-4b9e-8f1b-e7d1db7aabcf. But it frightend her very much when he said, "I need to break your monitors so I can get a Lightning Shield, some 1-Ups and enough rings to enter my super form."

"Please don't touch it," cried 7523af21-092b-4fe5-b88b-63c96644847f in great distress. "The monitors are the walls of my house, and if you smash them will make a hole, and the wind and rain will come in and make me shortcircuit. Do go away. I am sure you are not a pathetic friend, but our wicked enemy the Hedgehog."

And poor 7523af21-092b-4fe5-b88b-63c96644847f began to static and to dial-up, and to wish that she had not been such a greedy little Ballhog, and had chosen a more solid material than monitors for her house. But it was too late now, and in another minute the Hedgehog had smashed his way through the monitor walls, and had caught the trembling, shivering 7523af21-092b-4fe5-b88b-63c96644847f and carried her off to his best friend's workshop.

The next day the Hedgehog started off for 8204615c-350b-4fbd-97ab-66157d3934c5's house, because he had made up his mind that he would get the three little Ballhogs together in his best friend's workshop, and then get said friend to turn them good, and invite all his pathetic friends to an anti-Eggman party. But when he reached the brick house, he found that the door was locked behind the digital deluxe edition, so in his way-past-cool manner he began, "Hey, let me in, 8204615c-350b-4fbd-97ab-66157d3934c5. I have cartridges for Sonic 3 & Knuckles and a Retrode so that you can play Sonic 3 AIR post-delist."

"No, no, Mister Hedgehog," replied 8204615c-350b-4fbd-97ab-66157d3934c5. "I am not gong to open my door to you, because I'm only on Android and therefore do not pay for stuff anyway. And besides, I know your cunning ways. You have carried off poor f9701156-7ce4-4b9e-8f1b-e7d1db7aabcf and 7523af21-092b-4fe5-b88b-63c96644847f, but you are not going to get me."

At this the Hedgehog was so angry that he spindashed with all his force against the wall, and tried to knock it down. But it was too strong and well built. And though the Hedgehog rolled and jumped at the bricks with his spines, he only halted his momentumn, and at last he had to give it up, and limp away with his spines all bleeding and sore.

"Never mind!" he said (SEGA won't let him cry) angrily as he went off. "I'll catch you another day, see if I don't, and won't I grind your joints to powder when I have got you in my best friend's workshop!" And he made a weird face and thought his best friend was gonna crash, aaah!

Next day 8204615c-350b-4fbd-97ab-66157d3934c5 had to go into the neighboring town to do some marketing and to buy a big kettle. As he was bouncing home with it slung over his shoulder, he heard a sound of steps speedily running after him. For a moment his CPU stood still with fear, and then a happy thought came to him. He had just reached the top of a hill, and could see his own little house nestling at the foot of it among the trees. In a moment he had snatched the lid off the kettle and had jumped in himself. Coiling himself round, he lay quite snug in the bottom of the kettle, while with his foreleg he managed to put the lid on, so that he was able to build up enough momentumn to get down there as quickly as possible. With a little kick from the inside, he started the kettle off, and down the hill it rolled full tilt. And when the Hedgehog came up, all that he saw was a large black kettle spinning over the ground at a great pace. Very much disappointed, he was just going to turn away, when he saw the kettle stop close to the little brick house, and a moment later, 8204615c-350b-4fbd-97ab-66157d3934c5 jumped out of it and escaped with the kettle into the house, when he put up SEGA's preorder chart, and put the shutter up over the window.

"So!" exclaimed the Hedgehog to himself. "You know everything that I'm gonna do, but that's not gonna help you because I know everything you're gonna do!" And very quickly he boosted round the house looking for some way to spindash jump onto the roof.

In the meantime 8204615c-350b-4fbd-97ab-66157d3934c5 had filled the kettle with water, and having put it on the fire, sat down quietly waiting for it to boil. Just as the kettle was beginning to sing, and steam to come out of the spout, he heard a sound like a soft, muffled step, patter, patter, patter overhead, and the next moment the Hedgehog's head and forepaws were seen coming down the chimney. But 8204615c-350b-4fbd-97ab-66157d3934c5 very wisely had not put the lid on the kettle, and, with a bizzare face, the Hedgehog fell into the boiling water, and before he could escape, 8204615c-350b-4fbd-97ab-66157d3934c5 had popped the lid on, and the Hedgehog heard a nefarious tune, watched as the numbers went down, and then drowned.

As soon as he was sure that their wicked enemy was really dead, and could do them no further harm, 8204615c-350b-4fbd-97ab-66157d3934c5 started off to rescue f9701156-7ce4-4b9e-8f1b-e7d1db7aabcf and 7523af21-092b-4fe5-b88b-63c96644847f. As he approached the Hedgehog's best friend's workshop he heard piteous emails and sparks from his poor little brother and sister who lived in constant terror of the Hedgehog's friend reprogramming them. But when they saw 8204615c-350b-4fbd-97ab-66157d3934c5 appear at the entrance to the best friend's workshop, their joy knew no bounds. He quickly found a posh talking sword and cut the cords by which they were tied to a stake in the ground, and then all three started off together for 8204615c-350b-4fbd-97ab-66157d3934c5's house, where they lived happily ever after. And f9701156-7ce4-4b9e-8f1b-e7d1db7aabcf quite gave up rolling in the rocks, and 7523af21-092b-4fe5-b88b-63c96644847f ceased to be greedy, for they never forgot how nearly these faults had brought them to an untimely heel-face turn.
