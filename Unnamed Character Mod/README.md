# Unnamed "Character" Mod
Even though it isn't actually a character yet.

### This is a Work-in-progress and should absolutely not be considered a complete product!

This project is an attempt to build a new custom character in S3AIR. Right now, it's just a moveset switch for Tails. Since I don't know what kind of OC I want to make, I'm calling this character INH the ISH for now.

This mod will be licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3, so it will be reusable as long as the GPL is respected. 
  
Have any suggestions? I'll consider throwing them in. Code contributions to the project via the GitHub are also welcome! Just remember to read the license before sending a pull request.

### Known Issues

 - The air abilities malfunction if you obtain a shield and then lose it.
 - It is impossible to complete the game because you will dash during the 

If you find a glitch, please report it on the [issues tab](https://github.com/ShadowXeldron/ShadowXeldrons-S3AIR-Mods/issues)!
### Controls

These are the button inputs for the character's moves. Note that it refers to the standard buttons on a Mega Drive controller. For more information on how each move works, please read MOVESET.txt
Also, this character can't spindash.

#### Ground abilities

**C - Dash**
Gives you a slight boost of ground speed and inverts your current rolling state. By that, I mean:
 - If you're rolling, you'll be uncurled
 - If you're uncurled, you'll start rolling

**Down + Any Button - Dodge Roll**
Gives you a tiny bit of speed as well as a breif window of invulnerability. It can also be used to activate gimmicks that would've normally used the spindash.


#### Midair Abilities

**Up + Any Button - Rocket Boost**
Propels you upwards

**Down + Any Button - Re-Entry**
Causes you to plumet towards the ground with extreme downwards momentum

**Left/Right/None + Any Button - Jet Burst**
Grants a horizontal boost

#### Other Tweaks

- As mentioned above, you can't spindash. You also can't fly.
- It's possible to start rolling while inputting a direction. I may add a toggle to turn this off if it gets annoying

### To-do List

 - Actually come up with what kind of character I want to make
 - Get some custom sprites
 - Allow remapping of the dash buttons
 - Fix (or work around) the glitches
 - Other stuff

Never Asked Questions
-
  
Q. Is this an Extra Slot mod?
A: No. Because of the GPL license, I am unable to statically link with or use functions from mods that are not available under a GPL-compatible license. This also means that you cannot make an extra slot version. Finally, if any of you ask for an extra slot version regardless of this message, I'll snap your ankles.
  
Q. But what about Even More Themes? Isn't that a WIP?
A: Nobody said that I can't have two WIPs at once. And besides, at least these projects actually have something playable already and aren't just those vaporware WIPs that never get anywhere. (or worse, the meaningless concepts that the GB kids keep posting)

Q. kan u giv me purmishum 2 uze ur skript i wont chang it just put it in mi fnf sonci exe modd pak
A. The beauty of the GPL is that it means you don't actually need permission to utilise, modify and redistribute any GPL'd code, but I'd like to say that this mod will cause licensing complications if you try and bundle it with most scripts - especially ones that demand permission for usage. Instead, request users to download it on their own and have them load your mod above this one.
  
Q. How will the final release work?
A. It'll be in this repository and maybe GameBannana. I'd also like to see if I can get it on the forums, but because of how strict the approval process is there's a possibility that it won't be able to be on there.
