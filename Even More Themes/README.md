# Even More Themes
Yes, even more.

### This is a Work-in-progress and should absolutely not be considered a complete product!

This is a small project of mine to basically add unique themes for a few more parts of the game. 
This will implement:  
  

*   Music for during the FBZ laser fight
*   Seperate music for each segment of SSZ (inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xboohYrV-_U&list=PLqkCR3JKr7Q0FAiowwqwvWr3ysGYtl5d5&index=9&t=167s) video)
*   Seperate boss music for Knuckles (currently implemented!)  
*   Save select music (since the old mod seems to be broken)  
*   Seperate battle music for the fight against Knuckles in HPZ (successfully implemented, and in a more convoluted way than you might think)
*   Different music for every phase of the Death Egg Robot (including the bit where Eggman tries to escape) (implemented to a usuable standard; may require some polishing)      
*   Special Stage results music  
*   Unique music for all 14 Special Stages (successfully implemented!)  
*   Extra tracks for the following cutscenes:
    *   The AIZ opening cutscene with the plane (successfully implemented!)
    *   The cutscene in LBZ where the Death Egg launches
    *   The cutscene in HPZ where Eggman steals the Master Emerald
    *   The cutscene in SSZ where Sonic and/or Tails board the Death Egg (successfully implemented!)
* Seperate music for the continue screen
  
This mod will be licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3, so as with vanilla S3AIR and Per-Character Themes it will be reusable as long as the GPL is respected. (And also like Per-Character Themes it would probably be easier for us both if you don't include the scripts even though you're allowed to!)  
  
Have any suggestions? I'll consider throwing them in. Code contributions to the project via the GitHub are also welcome! Just remember to read the license before sending a pull request.  
  
Never Asked Questions
-
  
Q. Will Per-Character Themes be merged with this mod?  
A: Hell no! That'll bloat out my filesize way too much. I also think it would be easier to maintain them seperately.  
  
Q. Are you still going to work on Per-Character Themes?  
A: Yes. I have an update for that mod in the works as well; it's just I decided to start this WIP today.  
  
Q. kan u giv me purmishum 2 uze ur skript i wont chang it just put it in mi fnf sonci exe modd pak  
A. The beauty of the GPL is that it means you don't actually need permission to utilise, modify and redistribute any GPL'd code, but I'd like to say that this mod will cause licensing complications if you try and bundle it with most scripts - especially ones that demand permission for usage. Instead, request users to download it on their own and have them load your mod above this one.  
  
Q. Do you intend to add features from other mods?  
A. Only if they're discontinued or don't work. Of course, if I think I can do it better than them I may consider it.  
  
Q. How will the final release work?  
A. It'll be in this repository and maybe GameBannana. I'd also like to see if I can get it on the forums.
