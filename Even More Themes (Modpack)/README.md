# Even More Themes

Yes, even more.

### This is a Work-in-progress and should absolutely not be considered a complete product!

This is a small project of mine to basically add unique themes for a few more parts of the game.  All of these are standalone mods that provide a single function in a minimalist way with the intention of providing maximum compatibility. Also, each of them will have a unique functions


This will implement the following as standalone mods:  

* Music for during the FBZ laser fight
* Seperate music for each segment of SSZ (inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xboohYrV-_U&list=PLqkCR3JKr7Q0FAiowwqwvWr3ysGYtl5d5&index=9&t=167s) video)
* Seperate boss music for Knuckles (currently implemented!)  
* Save select music (since the old mod seems to be broken)  
* Seperate battle music for the fight against Knuckles in HPZ (successfully implemented, and in a more convoluted way than you might think)
* Different music for every phase of the Death Egg Robot (including the bit where Eggman tries to escape) (implemented to a usuable standard; may require some polishing)
* Special Stage results music  (RELEASED!)
* Unique music for all 14 Special Stages (successfully implemented!)  
* Extra tracks for the following cutscenes:
  * The AIZ opening cutscene with the plane (successfully implemented!)
  * The cutscene in LBZ where the Death Egg launches
  * The cutscene in HPZ where Eggman steals the Master Emerald
  * The cutscene in SSZ where Sonic and/or Tails board the Death Egg (successfully implemented!)
* Seperate music for the continue screen
* Any of the extra features from the Sonic DS music pack


Most of these mods should be licensed under the lax perimissive Apache license, and can be freely modified and redistributed as long as attribution is given. Certain mods however will need to use vanilla code to function and will therefore be licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3.0.
As well as being able to be included in mods, you can also interface with them via base function calls which is the intended way to use it.

All of the mods will include a series of

Have any suggestions? I'll consider throwing them in. Code contributions to the project via the GitHub are also welcome! Just remember to read the license before sending a pull request.  

Never Asked Questions
-

Q. Why did you reboot the project?
A: The original version of the mod was very unstable and was becoming a bit of a mess to debug.

Q. kan u giv me purmishum 2 uze ur skript i wont chang it just put it in mi fnf sonci exe modd pak  
A. It's Apache licensed now, so you don't even need to worry about the GPL anymore. See the text inside each mod's `main.lemon` for usage guidelines.

Q. Do you intend to add features from other mods?  
A. Only if they're discontinued or don't work. Of course, if I think I can do it better than them I may consider it.  

Q. How will the final release work?  
A. It'll be in this repository and maybe GameBannana. Because the community is so toxic, an official forum release is never happening.
