// This is code that I'm not really using, but I'm keeping around in case I need it

function u8 getCharID() // Function that checks for character IDs for supported mods
{
	u8 charID = getMainCharacter() // It made me do this in development, even though it let me off before

	/* For anyone reading this, I have a cheat sheet prepared for you all to know who's who under the wave of charIDs. 
	I thought that charID would be less of a pain to work this than nested Mods.modIsActives
		
	charID == 0 - Sonic
	charID == 1 - Tails
	charID == 2 - Knuckles
	charID == 3 - Mighty

	These IDs are reserved for future installments to the Extra Slot Project

	charID == 4 - Ray
	charID == 5 - Amy
	charID == 6 - Metal Sonic Kai (I'll also include Ultimate Metal in the mix as well)
	(Espio, you will be sorely missed)
			
	These IDs meanwhile are going to be kept around for when Sotaknuck eventually caves in and updates the rest of his stuff. All Sotaknuck IDs start with "1"

	charID == 10 - Ashura
	charID == 11 - Wechnia
	charID == 12 - Bluckles
	charID == 13 - Chaos
	charID == 14 - Shadow

	Finally, I'm saving this for later:

	charID == 666 - Sonic.EXE (There are METRIC CRAPTONS of EXE mods, so only the best ones are getting support on my end)

	I'd also like to some of the following if they get proper moveset mods:
			
	- Silver
	- Any Freedom Planet character
	- Sally
	- Cream
	- Mario

	// This checks if you're playing as Sonic with Ultimate Mighty loaded, or straight-up playing as Extra Slot Might.
	//Thanks to iCloudius for help on detecting if somebody is playing as Extra Slot Mighty.
